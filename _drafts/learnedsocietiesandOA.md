Our session on Lapis this week focused on scholarly publishing. This included an overview of early scholarly publishing from the first journal, the *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society*, through to the ['serials crisis'](http://sites.tufts.edu/scholarlycommunication/open-access/the-serials-crisis-explained/), with a hint of the topic of the next lecture, [open access](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&ved=0CCwQFjAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmitpress.mit.edu%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Ftitles%2Fcontent%2F9780262517638_Open_Access_PDF_Version.pdf&ei=04rwVNuCE9HcavmjgagE&usg=AFQjCNHvm7pKtSRqXqeeTRApX6Qhucw7jw&sig2=SGQ1oN8si1AOSlgsJn3krA&bvm=bv.87269000,d.d2s).

Following this, [Suzanne Kavanagh](https://twitter.com/sashers) gave a stimulating overview of some of the work done by [The Association for Learned & Professional Publishers](http://www.alpsp.org/) and some of the contemporary issues learned societies are having to think about. During the last part of the lecture we were split into groups to discuss a number of different scenarios currently, or potentially, facing learned societies.
