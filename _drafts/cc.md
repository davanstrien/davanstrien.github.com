## Intellectual Property

In our most recent LAPIS lecture we discussed the development of the book trade, intellectual property and piracy. Instead the history of the book trade, which is covered in one of [classmates blogs](http://harkirankalsi1.blogspot.co.uk/2015/02/session-4-history-of-book-trade.html), I thought I would limit my focus to some of the potential difficulties caused by intellectual property rights, especially in the context of teaching and research and discuss potential solutions which have been proposed.

## Current difficulties

Intellectual property emerged as an attempt to protect the economic interests of producers of a variety of different intellectual outputs. Intellectual property rights don't just protect a particular material object i.e. a particular copy of *Harry Potter* but instead, this protection extends to the content contained within *Harry Potter*. It would therefore not be possible for me to copy the material in the book and create my own edition of *Harry Potter*. Some form of Copyright exists in essentially every country in the world. Most of these copyright laws share some temporal limitations and have exceptions for fair use. These are intended to balance the protection of material for the creator (whether an individual or corporation) with the desire to make these innovations accessible more broadly. However, there are potential problems with the current forms of copyright law.  

### Interpreting fair use
Most common forms of copyright include some form of exception for 'fair use'. Common exemptions tend to include all, or some of the following (or something similar):

- Non-commercial research and private study
- Text and data mining for non-commercial research
- Criticism, review and reporting current events
- Teaching
- Helping disabled people
- Personal copying for private use
- Parody, caricature and pastiche
- Certain permitted uses of orphan works
- Sufficient acknowledgment
- Fair dealing[^1]

Although the above provide some exemptions, there can be difficulty interpreting how exactly these apply in specific cases. As an example, the use of text and data mining has often been hindered not by technical limitations but rather by uncertainty about copyright. In other cases someone might no reuse an image, or piece of text because they are worried about copyright infringement. It is with these sorts of difficulties in mind that Creative Commons licences were introduced.  

## Creative Commons


## Gratis or Libre (free beer or free speach)
Whilst the open access movement has partially been about ensuring free access to published materials, some have argued it should go beyond that. Although an article maybe open access in the sense that it is free to access it, beyond this it can have the usual copyright restrictions associated with 'traditionally' published articles. Other articles published in an open access form might have a licence that allows for a variety of different types of use or reuse. This has led to the characterisation of two flavours of open access Gratis and Libre. The primary difference between the two is interms of what can be done with content of that work. Gratis OA is free as in free beer, Libre is free as in free speech. One can be freely accessed the other freely (to different extents) used and reused.
