## Intellectual Property

In our most recent LAPIS lecture we discussed the development of the book trade, intellectual property and piracy. Instead the history of the book trade, which is covered in one of [classmates blogs](http://harkirankalsi1.blogspot.co.uk/2015/02/session-4-history-of-book-trade.html), I thought I would limit my focus to some of the potential difficulties caused by intellectual property rights, especially in the context of teaching and research and discuss potential solutions which have been proposed.

## Current difficulties

Intellectual property emerged as an attempt to protect the economic interests of producers of a variety of different intellectual outputs. Intellectual property rights don't just protect a particular material object i.e. a particular copy of *Harry Potter* but instead, this protection extends to the content contained within *Harry Potter*. It would therefore not be possible for me to copy the material in the book and create my own edition of *Harry Potter*. Some form of Copyright exists in essentially every country in the world. Most of these copyright laws share some temporal limitations and have exceptions for fair use. These are intended to balance the protection of material for the creator (whether an individual or corporation) with the desire to make these innovations accessible more broadly. However, there are potential problems with the current forms of copyright law.
