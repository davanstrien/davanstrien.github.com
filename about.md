Hi I'm Daniel, I study at [#CITYLIS](http://www.city.ac.uk/department-library-information-science/information-studies), work part-time in a hospital library and, hang out in London. I'll mostly blog about libraries, open-access publishing, and other random thoughts. You can find an old blog that was a requirement for a course at #Citylis [here](https://dvanstriendita14.wordpress.com/)
