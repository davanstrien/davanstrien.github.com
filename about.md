Hi I'm Daniel.  I am a librarian interested in digital scholarship, open access and supporting research. I recently graduated from [#citylis](http://www.city.ac.uk/department-library-information-science/information-studies) where I completed a Masters Disseration looking at the Wellcome Trusts open access policy in comparison with the Austrian Science Fund and HEFCE mandates. I am currently learning Python something which I will blog about from time to time. I have a particular interest in the role libraries/librarians can play in bridging the gap between researchers, and digital collections and tools. 

 You can find an old blog I did as part of my #citylis course [here.](https://dvanstriendita14.wordpress.com/)
