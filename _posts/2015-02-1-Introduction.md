Following on from my [earlier efforts](https://dvanstriendita14.wordpress.com/) at blogging for my *'Digital Technologies and Architectures'* course I have decided to make a fresh start for my next round of blogging. I've decided to switch to blogging using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). This blog will primarily be used to blog about a new course I'm starting this term: *Libraries and Publishing in an Information Society*. In the future I aim to do semi-regular posts around my dissertation topic.
